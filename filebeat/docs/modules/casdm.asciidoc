== CA SDM module

This is the CA Service Desk Manager module.

include::../include/what-happens.asciidoc[]

[float]
=== Compatibility

The stdlog format has stayed the same for ages so that should be compatible with all versions since r11.
Some filesets are not applicable for older versions, like for example the REST API Tomcat log fileset for pre-r12 versions, but they do not break the functionality of this module.


include::../include/running-modules.asciidoc[]

include::../include/configuring-intro.asciidoc[]

TODO: provide an example configuration

:fileset_ex: {fileset}

include::../include/config-option-intro.asciidoc[]

TODO: document the variables from each fileset. If you're describing a variable
that's common to other modules, you can reuse shared descriptions by including
the relevant file. For example:

[float]
==== `{fileset}` log fileset settings

include::../include/var-paths.asciidoc[]

:has-dashboards!:

:fileset_ex!:

:modulename!:

=== Fields

For a description of each field in the module, see the
<<exported-fields-casdm,exported fields>> section.
